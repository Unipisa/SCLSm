# SCLSm
The Stochastic CLS machine

The Stochastic CLS machine (SCLSm) is a simulator of biological systems based on the Stochastic Calculus of Looping Sequences (Stochastic CLS). The Stochastic CLS is a formalism based on term rewriting that has been developed to describe biomolecular systems in cells. SCLSm is a simulator having Stochastic CLS as its input language and that has been implemented with scalability in mind.
